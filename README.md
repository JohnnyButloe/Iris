# Iris
This Jupyter notebook contains a comprehensive exploration of the famous Iris dataset using the scikit-learn library in Python. The code begins by loading the Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal and petal lengths and widths for three different species of iris flowers. The data is split into training and testing sets, and a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier is trained on the training set. The model's accuracy is evaluated on the test set, and the trained model is persisted to a file named 'mlbrain.joblib' for future use. Subsequently, the persisted model is loaded and used to make predictions on a sample input.

To visualize the dataset, the code generates a scatter plot depicting two selected features of the iris flowers. Additionally, a scatter plot matrix is created to showcase relationships between pairs of features, with the size of points determined by one of the features. These visualizations provide a clear overview of the dataset's structure and help in understanding the distribution of iris flowers across different species. The use of Jupyter notebook facilitates an interactive and exploratory data analysis process, combining code execution with visual representations to gain insights into the Iris dataset and the machine learning model's performance.
